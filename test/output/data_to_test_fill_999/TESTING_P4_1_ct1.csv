#*COMMENTS
#    The descent rate of the CTD was very noisy.
#    CTDEDIT was used to remove some near-surface records and records
#	corrupted by shed wakes; salinity was cleaned.
#
#    Data Processing Notes:
#    ----------------------
#    Fluorescence and PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were
#	removed in editing temperature and salinity and a large spike in
#	fluorescence was removed from file 0032.
#
#    The Transmissivity channel was removed because of frequent shifts in values during
#	casts and large variations between values during repeat casts.
#	The data are available, by request, from the chief scientist.
#
#    NOTE: While the Fluorescence:CTD data are expressed in concentration units, they
#	do not always compare well to extracted chlorophyll samples, particularly for
#	casts far from shore. It is recommended that users check extracted chlorophyll
#	values where available.
#
#    Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD was calibrated using the method described in Sea-Bird
#	Application Note #64-2, June 2012 revision (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf), except 
#	that a small offset in the fit was allowed.
#
#    The Dissolved Oxygen sensor used in files 0001, 0002 and 0016 malfunctioned so the 
#	Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD channels were removed from those files.
#
#    The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD sensor has a fairly long response time so data accuracy 
#	is not as high when it is in motion as it is during stops for bottles. This will be
#	especially true when vertical dissolved oxygen gradients are large. To get an estimate
#	of the accuracy of the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data during downcasts (after recalibration)
#	a rough comparison was made between downcast Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data and upcast 
#	titrated samples. Some of the difference will be due to problems with flushing of 
#	Niskin bottles and/or analysis errors, so the following statement likely underestimates 
#	Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD accuracy.
#
#    Downcast (CTD files) Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered, very roughly, to be:
#	±0.25 ml/l from 0 to 125 dbar.
#	±0.2 ml/l from 125 to 400 dbar.
#	±0.1 ml/l from 400 to 600 dbar.
#	±0.05 ml/l from 600 to 1500 dbar.
#	Low by up to 0.08 ml/l below 1500 dbar.
#
#    For details on the processing see document: 2017-01-proc.pdf.
