#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity - Fluorescence - PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the transmissivity calibration parameters were calculated see the document Transmissivity_Calculation.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD was calibrated using the method described in the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 of June 2012 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf) except that a small offset in the fit was allowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered very roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.8 ml/l from 0 to 50 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.6 ml/l from 50 to 100 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.2 ml/l from 100 to 250 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.15 ml/l from 250 to 800 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.04 ml/l below 800 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on the processing see the report 2014-18-proc.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
