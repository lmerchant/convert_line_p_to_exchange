#Transmissivity - fluorescence and PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data in the CTD files should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#± 0.8 ml/l from 0 to 250 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#± 0.2 ml/l below 250 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Data below 1200 dbar are considered unreliable by the manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
