#Fluorescence - Transmissivity - PAR are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#• ± 0.6 ml/l from 0 to 200 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#• ± 0.4 ml/l from 200 to 400 dbar; values tend to be somewhat high in this high gradient region.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#• ± 0.2 ml/l below 400 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#• data below 500 dbar tend to be low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#• data below 1000 dbar are considered unreliable by the manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
