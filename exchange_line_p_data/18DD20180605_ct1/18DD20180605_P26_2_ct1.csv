#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity - Fluorescence - PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#NOTE: While the Fluorescence:CTD data are expressed in concentration units they do not always compare well to extracted chlorophyll samples particularly for casts far from shore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#It is recommended that users check extracted chlorophyll values where available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD was calibrated using the method described in the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 of June 2012 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf) except that a small offset in the fit was allowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD sensor has a fairly long response time so data accuracy is not as high when it is in motion as it is during stops for bottles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#This will be especially true when vertical dissolved oxygen gradients are large. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#To get an estimate of the accuracy of the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data during downcasts (after recalibration) a rough comparison was made between downcast Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data and upcast titrated samples. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Some of the difference will be due to problems with flushing of Niskin bottles and/or analysis errors so the following statement likely underestimates Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD accuracy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Downcast (CTD files) Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered very roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.30 ml/l from 0 to 100 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.15 ml/l from 100 to 300 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.10 ml/l from 300 to 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.04 ml/l below 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
