#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity - fluorescence - PAR are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Salinity:Practical:CTD was recalibrated based on a comparison with samples analyzed at IOS on an Autosal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Other samples run at sea on a Portasal appear unreliable based on a study of duplicates run on the two salinometers. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#    • ± 0.5 ml/l from 0 to 125 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#    • ± 0.2 ml/l from 125 to 400 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#    • ± 0.1 ml/l from 400 to 1200 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#    • data below 1200 dbar are considered unreliable by the manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
