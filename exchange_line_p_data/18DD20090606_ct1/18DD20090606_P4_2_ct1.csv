#Transmissivity - fluorescence - PAR are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The precision of the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD channel is difficult to estimate because the comparison with bottles was very noisy but roughly the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.4 ml/l from 0 to 150 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.08 ml/l from 150 to 450 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.04 ml/l from 450 to 2000 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l below 2000 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissometer #1005DR was calibrated in March 2008 and drifted significantly but steadily until July 2009. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Then a sudden shift occurred so that maximum values between September 2009 and July 2010 were very low by about 25 %/m. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#In August 2010 a study was made of transmissivity that led to a decision to apply post-processing corrections to all cruises between March 2008 and June 2010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity data from this cruise were corrected by multiplying the original values by a correction factor which was based on assumptions that deep offshore transmissivity from a June 2009 cruise should be about 62 %/m and that drift was linear with time between March 2008 and July 2009. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The corrections produced reasonable results for all cruises in that time period. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the correction factor was derived see Transmissometer_1005DR_Corrections.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#These data should be considered estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
