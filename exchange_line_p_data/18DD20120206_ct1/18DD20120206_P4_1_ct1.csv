#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity and PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Fluorescence data were recalibrated to correct an error in the scale factor used in the original conversion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The data are still considered nominal and are unedited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the transmissivity calibration parameters were calculated see the document Transmissivity_Calculation.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD calibration was done using the method described in the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Feb2010.pdf).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.3 ml/l from 0 to 300 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l from 300 dbar to 800 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.05 ml/l below 800 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on the processing see processing report 2012-01-proc.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
