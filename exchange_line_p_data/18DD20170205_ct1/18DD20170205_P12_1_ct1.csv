#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Fluorescence and PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity and a large spike in fluorescence was removed from file 0032.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Transmissivity channel was removed because of frequent shifts in values during casts and large variations between values during repeat casts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The data are available by request from the chief scientist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#NOTE: While the Fluorescence:CTD data are expressed in concentration units they do not always compare well to extracted chlorophyll samples particularly for casts far from shore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#It is recommended that users check extracted chlorophyll values where available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD was calibrated using the method described in the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 of June 2012 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf) except that a small offset in the fit was allowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#"The Dissolved Oxygen sensor used in files 0001, 0002 and 0016 malfunctioned so the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD channels were removed from those files.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD sensor has a fairly long response time so data accuracy is not as high when it is in motion as it is during stops for bottles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#This will be especially true when vertical dissolved oxygen gradients are large. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#To get an estimate of the accuracy of the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data during downcasts (after recalibration) a rough comparison was made between downcast Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data and upcast titrated samples. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Some of the difference will be due to problems with flushing of Niskin bottles and/or analysis errors so the following statement likely underestimates Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD accuracy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Downcast (CTD files) Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered very roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.25 ml/l from 0 to 125 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.2 ml/l from 125 to 400 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l from 400 to 600 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.05 ml/l from 600 to 1500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • Low by up to 0.08 ml/l below 1500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
