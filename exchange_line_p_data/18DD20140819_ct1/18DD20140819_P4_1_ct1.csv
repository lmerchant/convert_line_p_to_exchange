#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity - Fluorescence - PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity and some blocks of obviously bad values were removed from some of the deep casts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the transmissivity calibration parameters were calculated see the document Transmissivity_Calculation.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD was calibrated using the method described in the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 of June 2012 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf) except that a small offset in the fit was allowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The calibration for the Oxygen:Dissolved sensor #0997 shifted during the cruise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#This appears to have been an abrupt change so separate corrections were applied for events (files) 0007 to 0049 and 0052 to 0117. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered very roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.5 ml/l from 0 to 150 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.3 ml/l from 150 to 300 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l from 300 to 1000 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.05 ml/l from 1000 to 2000 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l below 2000 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
