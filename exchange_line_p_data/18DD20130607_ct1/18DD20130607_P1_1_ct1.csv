#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity - Fluorescence - PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the transmissivity calibration parameters were calculated see the document Transmissivity_Calculation.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Based on the recommendation from Sea-Bird the method for calibration of Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD concentration was changed from that used for 2011 and some 2012 cruises. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For more information see the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are of lower quality than usual with small-scale noise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For casts 0018 to 0022 the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are not considered reliable enough to archive based on comparison with bottles and differences between primary and secondary temperatures for those casts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For other casts the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD values are considered roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.5 ml/l from 0 to 150 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.3 ml/l from 150 to 300 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l from 300 to 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.06 ml/l from 500 to 2500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.04 ml/l below 2500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Salinity:CTD data was found to be low by an average of <0.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#No recalibration was applied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
