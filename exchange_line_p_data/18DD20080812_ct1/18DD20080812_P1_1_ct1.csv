#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity fluorescence  and PAR are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#There was no recalibration of Salinity:Practical:CTD based on the bottle comparison because of uncertainties about the performance of the two salinometers used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Post-cruise calibrations show Salinity:Practical:CTD is within 0.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.5 ml/l from 0 to 10 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.25 ml/l from 10 to 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l from 500 to 1500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.05 ml/l below 1500 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
