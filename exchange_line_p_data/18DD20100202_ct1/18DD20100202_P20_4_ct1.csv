#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity and PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Fluorescence data were removed because of severe problems with spikes and higher than usual values at depth suggesting problems with the cable. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The data may be obtained from the chief scientist. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The precision of the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD channel is difficult to estimate because the comparison with bottles was very noisy but roughly the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.15 ml/l from 0 to 100 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.5 ml/l from 100 to 400 dbar (values tend to be too high),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.2 ml/l from 400 to 600 dbar (values tend to be slightly high),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.04 ml/l from 600 to 2000 dbar (values tend to be slightly low),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.01 ml/l below 2500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#Transmissometer #1005DR was calibrated in March 2008 and drifted significantly but steadily until July 2009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Then a sudden shift occurred so that maximum values between September 2009 and July 2010 were very low by ~25% / m. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#In August 2010 a study was made of transmissivity that led to a decision to apply post-processing corrections to all cruises between March 2008 and June 2010. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity data from this cruise were corrected by multiplying the original values by correction factor 2.26 which was based on the assumption that deep offshore transmissivity should be about 62% / m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on the transmissometer post-processing see: Transmissometer_1005DR_Corrections.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#These data should still be considered nominal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
