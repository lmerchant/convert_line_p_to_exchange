#Fluorescence - Transmissivity - PAR are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data in the CTD files should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#    • ± 0.4 ml/l from 0 to 150 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#    • ± 0.2 ml/l from 150 to 400 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#    • ± 0.1 ml/l from 400 to 1200 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#    • data below 1200 dbar are considered unreliable by the manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
