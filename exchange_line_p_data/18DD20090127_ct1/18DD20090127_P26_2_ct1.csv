#Transmissivity Fluorescence and PAR are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#COMMENTS FOR FILES 0001 TO 0040:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data for this cruise were recalibrated in three steps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The first correction was applied to data from above 1400 dbar and to all of cast 0040.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The second was applied to data below 1400 dbar from casts 0015 to 0038.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The final correction was applied to all data. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data below 1400 dbar are very noisy and are considered less reliable because of the noisy signal; the limitations in the calibration; and because it was impossible to fine-tune the configuration parameters to get the best possible deep data; so there may be some hysteresis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.4 ml/l from 0 to 200 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l from 200 to 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.04 ml/l from 500 to 1500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.2 ml/l below 1500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#COMMENTS FOR FILES 0046 TO 0060:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#There were no bottle samples available to recalibrate the dissolved oxygen sensor used for this cast. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Recalibration was based only on an inter-comparison of repeat casts at station P26; one with sensor #0997 (used for casts 0001 to 0040) and two with sensor #1119 (used for casts 0046 to 0060). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The casts were separated in time by 4 to 6 hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Temporal variations were found to be very large between 100 and 700 dbar during repeat casts using a single sensor so the inter-comparison of sensors was limited to the mixed layer from 0 to 100 dbar and below 700 dbar. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#This limits the range included in the fit to high and low values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#A final calibration applied was based on studies of sensor #0997.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The comparisons in areas of low Oxygen:Dissolved gradients suggest that this sensor performed well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#A rough estimate suggests that the data is likely to be within:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.4 ml/l from 0 to 200 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.2 ml/l below 200 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissometer #1005DR was calibrated in March 2008 and drifted significantly but steadily until July 2009. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Then a sudden shift occurred so that maximum values between September 2009 and July 2010 were very low by about 25 %/m. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#In August 2010 a study was made of transmissivity that led to a decision to apply post-processing corrections to all cruises between March 2008 and June 2010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity data from this cruise were corrected by multiplying the original values by a correction factor which was based on assumptions that deep offshore transmissivity from a June 2009 cruise should be about 62 %/m and that drift was linear with time between March 2008 and July 2009. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The corrections produced reasonable results for all cruises in that time period. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on the transmissometer post-processing see: Transmissometer_1005DR_Corrections.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#These data should still be considered nominal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
