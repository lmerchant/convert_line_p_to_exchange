#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity - Fluorescence - PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For events 0001 to 0039 the Fluorescence:CTD channel was removed due to a malfunction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the transmissivity calibration parameters were calculated see the document Transmissivity_Calculation.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Based on the recommendation from Sea-Bird the method for calibration of Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD concentration was changed from that used for 2011 and some 2012 cruises. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For more information see the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered very roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±1.0 ml/l from 0 to 100 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.4 ml/l from 100 to 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.06 ml/l below 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The two Salinity:CTD channels differed by about 0.006 with one reading lower than bottles and the other higher. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Delay in analysis likely caused some evaporation of samples so the two salinity channels are likely reading higher than the comparison suggests. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The little information available suggests that there has been little calibration drift in the primary salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on the processing see the report 2013-18-proc.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
