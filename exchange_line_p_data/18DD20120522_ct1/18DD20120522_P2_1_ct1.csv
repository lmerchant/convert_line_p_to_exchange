#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity - Fluorescence - PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the transmissivity calibration parameters were calculated see the document Transmissivity_Calculation.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD calibration was done using the method described in the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2  (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l from 0 to 125 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.06 ml/l from 125 dbar to 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.04 ml/l from 500 dbar to 2000 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.02 ml/l below 2000 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on the processing see processing report 2012-12-proc.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
