#COMMENTS FOR CASTS 0001 TO 0032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#CTD Serial Number 0506; SBE Dissolved Oxygen sensor Serial Number 1176.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#As has been noted from several other cruises using Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD sensor #1176 in the summer 2010 the data are odd for some casts (casts 0022 to 0032) with concentration values offset by approximately 0.24 ml/l from the normal-looking casts and a higher noise level in the raw oxygen voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Data were recalibrated to correct for this offset but there were only 3 casts with titrated dissolved oxygen samples for the normal casts and 1 from the odd casts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Establishing which casts require the special recalibration was based on the noise level in the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD voltage and information from other cruises was used to recalibrate the odd casts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The quality of the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD calibration is considered lower than usual and there are insufficient data to make precision estimates. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#COMMENTS FOR CASTS 0036 TO 0129,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#CTD Serial Number 0443; SBE Dissolved Oxygen sensor Serial Number 1483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#There are only 3 casts with titrated dissolved oxygen samples that could be compared to the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data for sensor #1438 and 1 of them looked significantly different in the comparison from the other 2. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Recalibration of dissolved oxygen was based on the 2 casts that looked similar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#There are insufficient data to make a precision estimate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD sensor #1438 values below 2200 dbar were replaced by pad values because there is evidence of significant hysteresis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Salinity:Practical data from CTD #0443 showed evidence of flow rate problems in the top 200 dbar; the two-sided noise caused by that was minimized by bin-averaging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#***********************************************************************,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#In June 2011 it was discovered that the wrong information was used for conversion of the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD sensor data for CTD #0443.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Sensor #1483 was actually used for this cruise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD channel was reprocessed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#A new recalibration scheme was found by rerunning the bottle comparison. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The files were then merged with all the other channels from the original processing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The hysteresis noted in the original processing remains and the quality of the data is still considered of lower quality than usual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Note that the correct calibration information for the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD sensor can be found at the end of the processing report along with detail about how the reprocessing was done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
