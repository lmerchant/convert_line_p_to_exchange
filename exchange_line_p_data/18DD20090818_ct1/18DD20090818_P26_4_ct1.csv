CTD,20190304CCHSIOLMM
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity and fluorescence are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#There were many problems with CTD pumps and extreme variations in the descent rate of the CTD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD and Fluorescence:CTD channels were removed from some casts due to pump problems and more data than usual were lost due to corruption from shed wakes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Editing of Salinity:Practical:CTD was more extensive than usual from the base of the mixed layer to about 150 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#There remain some unstable T-S features and the quality of the data is considered lower than usual. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD calibration drifted through the cruise so that the comparison of CTD and bottles did not lead to a simple recalibration scheme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Recalibration of the data was done in a very subjective fashion using 10 different fits based on the calibration data available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Thus the quality of the data is not as high as usual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#A final Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD correction was applied after problems were found in the titrated Oxygen:Dissolved:Bottle values upon which the original calibrations were based.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The precision of the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD channel is difficult to estimate because the comparison with bottles was very noisy but roughly the data should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.5 ml/l from 0 to 300 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.15 ml/l from 300 to 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.06 ml/l from 500 to 2000 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l below 2000 dbar (Below 2000 dbar the data are mostly low by about 0.06 ml/l),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
