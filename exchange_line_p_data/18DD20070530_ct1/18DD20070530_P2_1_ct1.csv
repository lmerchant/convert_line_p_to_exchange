#---------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity and fluorescence are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data in the CTD files should be considered:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#± 0.5 ml/l from 0 to 75 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#± 0.8 ml/l from 75 to 300 dbar; data tend to be somewhat high in this high gradient region.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#± 0.25 ml/l below 300 dbar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Data below 800 dbar tend to be low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Data below 1200 dbar are considered unreliable by the manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
