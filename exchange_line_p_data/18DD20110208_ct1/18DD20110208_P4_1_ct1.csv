#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Fluorescence - Transmissivity and PAR data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the transmissivity calibration parameters were calculated see the document Transmissivity_Calculation.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD calibration was done using the method described in the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Feb2010.pdf).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#A shift in the Oxygen:Dissolved:Bottle standardization parameters occurred between events 0032 and 0044; this was not investigated to determine if the resultant change in Thiosulfate normality was real or the result of a shift in lab temperature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Checks of the fit of Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD against titrated Oxygen:Dissolved:Bottle suggest that the titrated values from the first part of the cruise are lower than those of the latter part by about 0.02 ml/l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD was recalibrated using titrated Oxygen:Dissolved:Bottle data from the whole cruise so any resultant error in the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD is likely negligible compared to other sources of error (<0.01 ml/l).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD channel was corrupted for all or parts of events 0007 - 0010 - 0015 - 0017 - 0018 - 0019 - 0021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#WARNING: The dissolved oxygen sensor was found to have a damaged membrane when it was examined at the factory shortly after this cruise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#There is evidence of hysteresis which could not be corrected by adjusting the calibration parameters. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD:Volume data are considered roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.4 ml/l from 0 to 125 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.3 ml/l from 125 dbar to 400 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l below 400 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Below 1000 dbar the Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD reads consistently low by <0.01 ml/l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
