#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Transmissivity - PAR - Fluorescence data are nominal and unedited except that some records were removed in editing temperature and salinity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#For details on how the transmissivity calibration parameters were calculated see the document Transmissivity_Calculation.pdf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Based on the recommendation from Sea-Bird the method for calibration of Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD concentration was changed from that used for 2011 and some 2012 cruises. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD calibration was done using the method described in the Sea-Bird Application Note #64-2 (Sea-Bird_64-2_Jun2012.pdf) with a modification allowing a small offset.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The Oxygen:Dissolved:CTD data are considered roughly to be:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.1 ml/l from 0 to 500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.035 ml/l from 500 dbar to 2500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#      • ±0.015 ml/l below 2500 dbar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
